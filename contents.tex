\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{What is the problem?}

There are numerous \acp{PET} out there that would make digital surveillance 
more difficult.
Why are they not used more and how can we change that?

For instance: Why do people not encrypt their emails?
Is it usability, does it introduce problems, or is it simply the network effect 
(no one else does it)?

Why do people not browse the web anonymously with Tor?
Is it usability, \ie too slow, makes web sites unusable (blocking some active 
contents)?
Or do people not see a problem?

Or do these technologies solve the wrong problem?

\paragraph{Why is it a problem?}

The answer to these questions will help researchers in the area of \acp{PET} to 
adapt their research and the tools they produce so that they get more 
wide-spread adoption.
This is especially important in this area since many privacy properties depend 
on many users~\cite{AnonymityLovesCompany}.

\paragraph{Why is this important?}

The importance of this is illustrated by examples like Cambridge 
Analytica~\cite{%
  cambridge-analytica-wired,
  cambridge-analytica-guardian,
  cambridge-analytica-nytimes,
  cambridge-analytica-wp%
}, where the data from the surveillance machine was used to manipulate entire 
populations.


\section{\Aclp{PET}}

WhatsApp started to introduce \ac{E2E} encryption for its users in 
2014~\cite{WhatsAppIntroducesE2Eencryption} (completed in 
2016~\cite{WhatsAppE2Ecomplete}).
It seems that this was more the company's political stance rather than user 
demand (TextSecure, now Signal, has been around since 2010).
