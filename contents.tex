\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{What is the problem?}

There are numerous \acp{PET} out there that would make digital surveillance 
more difficult.
Why are they not used more and how can we change that?

For instance: Why do people not encrypt their emails?
Is it usability, does it introduce problems, or is it simply the network effect 
(no one else does it)?

Why do people not browse the web anonymously with Tor?
Is it usability, \ie too slow, makes web sites unusable (blocking some active 
contents)?
Or do people not see a problem?

Or do these technologies solve the wrong problem?

\paragraph{Why is it a problem?}

The answer to these questions will help researchers in the area of \acp{PET} to 
adapt their research and the tools they produce so that they get more 
wide-spread adoption.
This is especially important in this area since many privacy properties depend 
on many users~\cite{AnonymityLovesCompany}.

\paragraph{Why is this important?}

The importance of this is illustrated by examples like Cambridge 
Analytica~\cite{%
  cambridge-analytica-wired,
  cambridge-analytica-guardian,
  cambridge-analytica-nytimes,
  cambridge-analytica-wp%
}, where the data from the surveillance apparatus was used to manipulate entire 
populations.


\section{Deployed \acp{PET}}

WhatsApp started to introduce \ac{E2E} encryption for its users in 
2014~\cite{WhatsAppIntroducesE2Eencryption} (completed in 
2016~\cite{WhatsAppE2Ecomplete}).
It seems that this was more the company's political stance rather than user 
demand (TextSecure, now Signal, has been around since 2010).

This prevents governments (\ie service providers) from reading the contents of 
users' messages.
But it still allows WhatsApp, and now Facebook, to see metadata, \ie who 
communicates with whom and when.
Some of this can also be inferred through traffic analysis by \eg Internet and 
telephony service providers.
Much information can be inferred from metadata~\cite{DevilInMetadata}.

Tor~\cite{Tor}, on the other hand, also hides metadata.
Its mainly known in the media for the \enquote{Dark Web}~\cite{?} and its main 
use comes through the Tor Browser~\cite{?}.
Tor Browser additionally blocks trackers, \enquote{Like Buttons} (\ie more 
trackers) and other elements that can be used for tracking (\eg browser 
fingerprinting).
This prevents web sites from tracking users.

However, Tor Browser cannot prevent the surveillance apparatus, \eg Facebook, 
from collecting data if the user actively uses Facebook.
One of the more known Facebook alternatives that comes the closest to solving 
the problem is diaspora*~\cite{?}.
All data is private to the individual, it tries to break the centralization 
which caused the metadata problems above, but it is not fully decentralized.


\section{Future \acp{PET}}

While decentralization removes this position of power for one entity, \eg 
Facebook, it also makes many things more difficult.
In a decentralized system, all transactions are made in public, this means that 
suddenly everyone is in Facebook's power position.
This must be considered when designing such systems.
We will now present some examples from our work.

One example of problems is access control.
As an example, Alice and Bob are friends on a decentralized social media 
platform.
Whenever Alice posts a photo or message, it is published in such a way that her 
friends know where to find it and they can decrypt, but no one else can.
Then, whenever Bob is no longer able to decrypt he can infer that Alice has 
removed him.
\Textcite{PPACinPubFS} analysed how access-control policy changes could leak in 
various ways through metadata available in such decentralized systems and 
suggested a way to reduce these leaks, in particular, to make such changes 
without Bob learning about it.
(This also implies that no one but Alice's friends can learn whenever Alice 
posts.)

Another example is sharing calendars and scheduling events.
\Textcite{EventsInvitations} proposed a protocol for inviting to and responding 
to invites for events in a privacy-preserving manner.
This allowed organizers to set varying levels of privacy, \eg that invitees 
cannot see who else is invited until they accept the invitation.

Bosk analysed the privacy implications of calendar sharing for scheduling 
events without active involvement of all people.
This allowed Bosk, Buchegger and Linus to \dots do what exactly?

As a final example, Bosk, Bouget, Buchegger and Gambs provided a protocol for 
privacy-preserving, yet verifiable crowd counting and petitions.
To some extent, this protocol combines location-based services and electronic 
voting.
(The location is not relevant in the case of petitions.)
This allows supporters of a cause to have a demonstration and to provide 
verifiable proof of the participation to third parties.
These proofs are unlinkable to a participant's identity, yet the participant 
cannot produce two proofs to be counted twice.
The latter is needed to for the correctness of the count, the former to protect 
against someone using a participant's participation against them.
